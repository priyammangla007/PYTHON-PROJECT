## Problem Statement

The Number Guessing Game project aims to develop an interactive console-based application that challenges users to guess a randomly generated secret number within a limited number of attempts. The game must provide real-time feedback guiding the player to guess higher or lower, validate all user inputs to prevent errors or duplicate guesses, and conclude by analyzing the player’s performance through a calculated probability of winning and estimating additional optimal guesses needed. This project addresses the need for an engaging educational tool that reinforces programming fundamentals, input validation, and algorithmic thinking.
